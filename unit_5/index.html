		<h2>Kick-Ass Cards</h2>

		<p>Welcome to Neptune's Laundry!</p>
		<p>Another card shop? Why? Shopping for cards is one of my favorite ways to pass the time on a quiet Saturday afternoon. I love the creativity that goes into a card that's not one-size-fits-all. Neptune's Laundry sets out to accomplish just that: peculiar cards with unique messages.</p>

		<section class="cards">
		<h3>Thank you cards</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>These cards are great for any audience and any occasion when all you need is to simply say thanks!</p>
